# AI specific FAQ

## What does general purpose mean?

dwata is not geared toward any specific type of data. It it built around the fact that recent AI models have become really good at understanding human language. It is a new interface to the computer.

In dwata, we can have chats with AI models around any problem. dwata can read data from many different sources (email, Slack, Stripe...) and easily share with AI to accomplish many tasks, like labelling of documents, renaming files depending on content, summarize large documents/email threads...

dwata helps in figuring out the steps that an AI may want us to take, say access further data, set a calendar reminder or run a piece of code. Therefore, dwata does not focus on a type of problem and should be able to behave as an assistant to our day to day issues.

## Can I compare chat from different models?

Yes! In dwata, you start a chat thread with an AI model. Then you can go into the thread and select to `compare` to any number of other models.

dwata will have a side by side view mode for this where your interactions are sent directly to all selected models in compare mode.

## What is multi-modal?

dwata is being built to have chats that include any type of "content", like text, code (like JavaScript/Python), image (photo of a product for example), audio (speech to text for example) or even video (detect objects or even video creation). These content can be both input to AI or output from AI.
