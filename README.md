## Emails, files, Slack... a thousand paper cuts

Getting everything in one place, searching across mutliple accounts, keeping track of todos, delegating information with others can all take up a lot of our daily time. Some days we are on top of our digital life, while on other days they drag us down.

If you relate to these:

- Do you keep multiple open browser tabs for your digital life?
- Do you struggle to search across all private data in one place?
- Do you travel often and need offline access to your data?
- Do you share multiple inboxes with partner or colleagues?
- Would you like some help in organising emails, files - like auto labelling folders?
- Would you like someone to check what emails need to be shared with your partner or co-founder so they are updated?
- And many more on these lines...

Then dwata is for you.

## How does dwata work?

dwata is an open source desktop app that gathers all your private data on to your laptop, manages them for you according to your workflow:

- Offline access to all stored data
- Blazing fast search on all documents (email, attachments, files, calendar...)
- Shows up contacts, events, tasks and much more from your data
- Will soon connect to Slack, Discord and many others
- Uses AI to label documents, get summary of documents (email threads)

## Why should I trust dwata?

Good question. I am Sumit, founder of dwata and I am building dwata with my best intentions to make sure our daily lives have less cognitive overhead.

In order to make sure that you can trust dwata, it is completely open source. dwata does not have any hidden telemetry - sends no data to my company (Pixlie, in India) without your explicit permission. All product analytics is stored inside dwata and is sent only after you see and confirm.

I take your privacy very seriously. I do not even have OAuth2 apps for Google to access your data - you have to create those yourself (there is documentation in the app).

AI providers can be run locally if you want to avoid hosted providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.

## How do I install dwata?

## What AI providers can I use?

If you want to use hosted AI providers with your own API keys you can use these:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)
- [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/product) - coming soon

If you want to run AI models on your computer (support for own cloud server coming soon) you can use these:

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library)
- [Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile)

## Does dwata send any of my private/business data to your company?

dwata does not send any private data to Pixlie, the parent company in India. Your data will be sent to AI as per your explicit choice.

dwata will send product usage analytics and error reports to Pixlie only if you explicitly allow this.

## How will dwata make money?

The Personal edition of dwata is completely free to use. Professional and Power plans are available with simple one time payment.

_Please remember that you pay for your AI model usage costs yourself (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, etc)_
